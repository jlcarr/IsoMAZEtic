# IsoMAZEtic
A Godot 2.5D game using isometric 1-bit pixel art. Maze puzzles revolving around interpreting isometric projections.

## Description
Technically the project is not isometric, but rather dimetric: a slightly different type of axonometric projection.

The art used for this project was procedurally generated by my related project [ProceduralPixelArt](https://github.com/jlcarr/ProceduralPixelArt).

### Projection
The projection is actually a **dimetric** projection, as opposed to a truly isometric one (See my ProceduralPixelArt project for details).  
To allow the objects in game to exist in the correct position for their projection.  

In Godot the camera's matrix can be obtained by the `get_camera_transform()` method, however it cannot be set directly.  
In the UI the camera's relevant settings are `Projection` (which should be set to Orthogonal, i.e. `PROJECTION_ORTHOGONAL`)
In Godot the `Camera` objects inherit from the `Spacial` class, which has the following properties:
   - `translation` which is the cartesian translation.
   - `rotation_degrees` which are the Euler XYZ-angles of rotation

NOTE: the `scale` property has no effects on cameras in Godot. The `Spacial` transform of the camera appears to be different from the camera matrix by the scaling factor.
